## Summary

  Autonomous vehicles, smart manufacturing, heterogeneous systems and
  new high-performance embedded computing (HPEC) applications can
  benefit from the reuse of code coming from the high-performance
  computing world. However, unlike for HPC, energy efficiency is
  critical in embedded systems, especially when running on battery
  power. Code base from HPC mostly relies on the MPI message passing
  runtime to deal with distributed systems. MPI has been designed
  primarily for performance and not for energy efficiency. One
  drawback is the way messages are received, in an energy-consuming
  busy-wait fashion. In this work we study a simple approach in which
  receiving processes are put to sleep instead of constantly
  polling. We implement this strategy at the user level to be
  transparent to the MPI runtime and the application. **EEProbe** is
  an open-source implementation of this strategy.

## Quick start

The `eetest` program is a basic send-receive MPI application in which
a process periodically sends messages to a receiver. This receiver
uses the `EEProbe` implementation of the micro-sleep strategy to save
CPU time while waiting for messages. The following instructions show
how to build and test this program.

Open a terminal:
```
cd C/
make
```

Open a second terminal and run the `top` command to monitor the CPU load:
```
top
```

On the first terminal, run the `eetest` program (`EEProbe disabled`):
```
mpirun --np 2 ./eetest disable
```

The `top` command should show that the `eetest` command takes 100% of the CPU.

On the first terminal, run the `eetest` program (`EEProbe enabled`):
```
mpirun --np 2 ./eetest
```

The `eetest` command should now take only a few percent of the CPU.



## Replace the default MPI `Probe` function with `EEProbe` in applications

`EEProbe` has been designed to transparently replace the default MPI
`Probe` function in the user code. The main function is
`EEPROBE_Probe`, which takes the same parameters as `Probe` and a
specific parameter to enable or disable the micro-sleeping
mechanism. This function is synchronous and returns when a matching
message is being delivered by the MPI runtime.

```
int EEPROBE_Probe(int srce, int tag, MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Status * status, EEPROBE_Enable enable);
```

The following code snippet shows how to use the `EEPROBE_Probe`
function before receiving a message.

```
#include "eeprobe.h"

void
receiveProcess(char * buffer, int count, int remote_rank) {

 int errno = MPI_SUCCESS;

 MPI_Status status;

 assert(buffer);
 assert(count > 0);

 EEPROBE_Probe(remote_rank, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD, &status, EEPROBE_ENABLE);

 errno = MPI_Recv(buffer, count, MPI_CHAR, remote_rank,
        	  0, MPI_COMM_WORLD, MPI_STATUS_IGNORE);

 assert(errno == MPI_SUCCESS);

}
```
